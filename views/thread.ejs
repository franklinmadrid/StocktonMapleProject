                                Our 2x6 evaporator runs like crap on #2 oil. We bought it used from a guy who owns an
                                oil company in VT. Clearly, they have the nozzle size and pressures set to run on K-1.
                                We have a stack temp of 700 degrees and a tight flame dispersion with K-1. Even running
                                a mix of the two, it runs like crap. The stack temp climbs to 900 and the flame is wider
                                and the whole evaporator runs worse with any #2 mixed in. Boil rates go from around 50
                                GPH to less than 40 GPH. Last year we tried #2 at the end of the year when we ran out
                                of K-1. This year we added a 2nd tank with K-1 in it and when we ran out, we swapped to
                                the other tank which was 80% K-1, 20% #2 oil and it ran the same as if it was all #2.
                                As mentioned, oil is also dirtier. It produces an oily soot compared to the dry soot
                                from K-1 that is much easier to clean and does not build up on the pans as badly. Point
                                is, we have learned the hard way there are nozzle and pressure settings for whatever you
                                want to run. Fortunately, it was on the last few boils each year. I am sure we could
                                change things to get a better boil with #2 oil but it works perfect with K-1 so why mess
                                with it. We have chose to stick with K-1 and bare that extra cost but I am tempted to
                                try some diesel. So the first question you should ask is what was the burner designed
                                to run on? Maybe our evaporator is overly sensitive but we will never run another ounce
                                of #2 in ours.

                                Had my oil fired for 3 seasons , always have run off road diesel in it . No issues and
                                always can find it cheaper than home heating oil around here. I would suggest no matter
                                what u get for a rig , and im gonna probly take heat for this, call cdl and have there
                                oil guy richard come tune it in !!! Well worth the money . Or if u end up with a new
                                cdl oil rig first time is free. Im sure theres more out there than him but hes made
                                mine run excellent.. just my 2 cents
